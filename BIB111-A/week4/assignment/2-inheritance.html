      Inheritance
    </h2>
    <p>
      The capability of a class to derive
      properties and characteristics from
      another class is called Inheritance.
      Inheritance is one of the most important
      feature of Object Oriented Programming.
      Sub Class: The class that inherits
      properties from another class
      is called Sub class or Derived Class.
      Super Class: The class whose properties
      are inherited by sub class is called Base
      Class or Super class. Using inheritance, we
      have to write the functions only one time
      instead of three times as we
      have inherited rest of the three classes
      from base class(Vehicle).

      <b>Mode of Inheritance : </b><br><br>

      <b>Public Mode : </b>If we derive a sub
      class from a public base class. Then the
      public member of the base class will
      become public in the derived class and
      protected members of the base class
      will become protected in derived class.
      <br><br>
      <b>Protected Mode : </b>If we derive a
      sub class from a Protected base class.
      Then both public member and protected
      members of the base class will become
      protected in derived class.
      <br><br>
      <b>Private Mode : </b>If we derive a
      sub class from a Private base class.
      Then both public member and protected
      members of the base class will become
      Private in derived class.
      <br><br>
      <b>Types of Inheritance in C++ : </b>
      <br><br><br>
      <b>Single Inheritance :</b> In single
      inheritance, a class is allowed to inherit
      from only one class. i.e. one sub class
      is inherited by one base class only.
      <br><br>
      <b>Multiple Inheritance :</b> Multiple
      Inheritance is a feature of C++ where a
      class can inherit from more than one
      classes. i.e one sub class is inherited
      from more than one base classes.
      <br><br>
      <b>Multilevel Inheritance :</b> In this
      type of inheritance, a derived class is
      created from another derived class.
      <br><br>
      <b>Hieratical Inheritance :</b> In this
      type of inheritance, more than one sub
      class is inherited from a single base
      class i.e. more than one derived class
      is created from a single base class.
      <br><br>
      <b>Hybrid (Virtual) Inheritance :</b>
      Hybrid Inheritance is implemented by
      combining more than one type of
      inheritance.
      For example: Combining Hierarchical
      inheritance and Multiple Inheritance.

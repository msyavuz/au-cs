      Abstraction
    </h2>
    <p>
      Data abstraction is one of the most
      essential and important feature of object
      oriented programming in C++. Abstraction
      means displaying only essential information
      and hiding the details. Data abstraction
      refers to providing only essential information
      about the data to the outside world,
      hiding the background details or implementation.
      <br> Consider a real life example of a man driving
      a car. The man only knows that pressing the
      accelerators will increase the speed of car
      or applying brakes will stop the car but he
      does not know about how on pressing accelerator
      the speed is actually increasing, he does
      not know about the inner mechanism of the car
      or the implementation of accelerator, brakes
      etc in the car. This is what abstraction is.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abstraction using Classes:</b> We can
      implement Abstraction in C++ using classes.
      Class helps us to group data members and member
      functions using available access specifiers. A
      Class can decide which data member will be
      visible to outside
      world and which is not.
      <br>
      <b>Abstraction in Header files:</b> One
      more type of abstraction in C++ can be
      header files. For example, consider the
      pow() method present in math.h header file.
      Whenever we need to calculate power of a
      number, we simply call the
      function pow() present in the math.h header
      file and pass the numbers as arguments
      without knowing the underlying algorithm
      according to which the function is actually
      calculating power of numbers.
      <br><br><b>Advantages of Data Abstraction:
      </b><br> 1. Helps the user to avoid writing
      the low level code.<br> 2. Avoids code
      duplication and increases reusability.<br>
      3. Can change internal implementation of
      class independently without
      affecting the user.<br> 4. Helps to
      increase security of an application or program
      as only important details are
      provided to the user.

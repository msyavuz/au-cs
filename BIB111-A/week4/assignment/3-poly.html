      Polymorphism
    </h2>
    <p>
      The word polymorphism means having many
      forms. In simple words, we can define
      polymorphism as the ability of a message
      to be displayed in more than one form.
      A real-life example of polymorphism, a
      person at the same time can have
      different characteristics.
      Like a man at the same time is a father,
      a husband, an employee. So the same
      person posses different behavior in
      different situations. This is called
      polymorphism. Polymorphism is considered
      as one of the important features of Object
      Oriented Programming.
      <br>
      <b>In C++ polymorphism is mainly
        divided into two types:</b>
      <br> 1. Compile time Polymorphism<br>
      2. Runtime Polymorphism
    </p>
    <p>Compile time polymorphism: This type of
      polymorphism is achieved by function
      overloading or operator overloading.
      <br> Runtime polymorphism: This type
      of polymorphism is achieved by
      Function Overriding.

    <p>
      Object-oriented programming â€“ As the name
      suggests uses objects in programming.
      Object-oriented programming aims to
      implement real-world entities like
      inheritance, hiding, polymorphism,
      etc in programming. The main
      aim of OOP is to bind together the data
      and the functions that operate on them
      so that no other part of the code can
      access this data except that function.
    </p>
    <p><b>Object : </b>An Object is an identifiable
      entity with some characteristics and behavior.
      An Object is an instance of a Class. When a
      class is defined, no memory is allocated but
      when it is instantiated (i.e. an
      object is created) memory is allocated.
      <br>
      <b>Class : </b>The building block of C++ that
      leads to Object-Oriented programming is a Class.
      It is a user-defined data type, which holds its
      own data members and member functions, which can
      be accessed & used by creating an instance
      of that class. A class is like a blueprint for
      an object. For Example: Consider the Class
      of Cars. There may be many cars with different
      names and brand but all of them will share
      some common properties like all of them will
      have 4 wheels, Speed Limit, Mileage range etc.
      So here, Car is the class and wheels,
      speed limits, mileage are their properties.

      Encapsulation
    </h2>
    <p>
      In normal terms Encapsulation is defined
      as wrapping up of data and information
      under a single unit. In Object Oriented
      Programming, Encapsulation is defined as
      binding together the data and the functions
      that manipulates them. Consider
      a real life example
      of encapsulation, in a company there are
      different sections like the accounts section,
      finance section, sales section etc. The finance
      section handles all the financial transactions
      and keep records of all the data related to
      finance.
      Similarly the sales section handles all the
      sales related activities and keep records of
      all the sales. Now there may arise a situation
      when for some reason an official from finance
      section needs all the data about sales in a
      particular
      month. In this case, he is not allowed to
      directly access the data of sales section.
      He will first have to contact some other
      officer in the sales section and then
      request him to
      give the particular data. This is what
      encapsulation is. Here the data of
      sales section and the
      employees that can manipulate them are
      wrapped under a single name “sales section”.
    </p>
    <p>
      Encapsulation also lead to data abstraction
      or hiding. As using encapsulation also hides
      the data. In the above example the data of
      any of the section like sales, finance or
      accounts is hidden from any other section.<br>
      In C++ encapsulation
      can be implemented using Class
      and access modifiers.
